  This ll1 parser works for non terminals S, A and B
  and terminals 0 and 1

  This does not require $ at the end of the input.

  1) See rules for the input file.  ; is used to mark the end 
  of each line.

  2) Run my demo program first.  Try 0110, 1001, 200, 0110000
  and 0111

  3) Observe the trace and error messages so that you can produce identical ones.

  4) Then complete ll1.cpp.
